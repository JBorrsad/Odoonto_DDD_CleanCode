# Application Service Guidelines

## When to apply

This rule activates whenever you create or modify files matching the glob patterns above.

## Responsibilities

- Coordinate use cases and domain operations.
- Use DTOs for input/output.
- Map entities to DTOs with AutoMapper.
- Handle high‑level validation.
- Remain thin—no persistence or UI logic.

## Best Practices

Follow the Clean Code and DDD principles documented in global rules. Keep the layer boundaries clear and respect dependency inversion.

## Code Example

See `DDD_Ejemplos_Codigo/7_Application_Service_Implementation.cs` for a full reference implementation.
