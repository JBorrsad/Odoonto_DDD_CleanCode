# Automapper Profile Guidelines

## When to apply

This rule activates whenever you create or modify files matching the glob patterns above.

## Responsibilities

- Define mappings between entities and DTOs.
- Configure custom member mappings and transformations.
- Register profile in dependency injection.

## Best Practices

Follow the Clean Code and DDD principles documented in global rules. Keep the layer boundaries clear and respect dependency inversion.

## Code Example

See `DDD_Ejemplos_Codigo/8_Application_AutoMapper_Profile.cs` for a full reference implementation.
