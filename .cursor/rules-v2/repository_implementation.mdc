# Repository Implementation Guidelines

## When to apply

This rule activates whenever you create or modify files matching the glob patterns above.

## Responsibilities

- Implement domain repository interfaces.
- Use FirebaseDbContext for Firestore access.
- Convert between Firestore documents and domain entities.
- Keep transaction logic inside repository.

## Best Practices

Follow the Clean Code and DDD principles documented in global rules. Keep the layer boundaries clear and respect dependency inversion.

## Code Example

See `DDD_Ejemplos_Codigo/3_Data_Repository_Implementation.cs` for a full reference implementation.
