# Infrastructure Inyector Guidelines

## When to apply

This rule activates whenever you create or modify files matching the glob patterns above.

## Responsibilities

- Register repositories, services, mappers and context.
- Keep registrations grouped by bounded context or module.
- Use scoped lifetime for repositories and services.

## Best Practices

Follow the Clean Code and DDD principles documented in global rules. Keep the layer boundaries clear and respect dependency inversion.

## Code Example

See `DDD_Ejemplos_Codigo/10_Infrastructure_Inyector.cs` for a full reference implementation.
