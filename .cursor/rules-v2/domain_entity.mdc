# Domain Entity Guidelines

## When to apply

This rule activates whenever you create or modify files matching the glob patterns above.

## Responsibilities

- Inherit from base Entity.
- Encapsulate state with private setters.
- Enforce invariants and business rules inside methods.
- Provide static factory methods for creation.
- Avoid anemic modelsâ€”include behavior.

## Best Practices

Follow the Clean Code and DDD principles documented in global rules. Keep the layer boundaries clear and respect dependency inversion.

## Code Example

See `DDD_Ejemplos_Codigo/1_Domain_Entity.cs` for a full reference implementation.
